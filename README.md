#2048 game - Python (Tkinter) 

Objective:
The goal of the 2048 game is to combine tiles on a 4x4 grid to reach the tile with the number 2048.

Components:

-> Grid: The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where each cell can contain a tile with a number.
-> Tiles: Tiles have numbers on them, initially starting with two random tiles with values 2 or 4.
-> Movement: The player can use arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles on the grid.

Game Logic:

-> When the player presses an arrow key, the tiles on the grid are moved in that direction.
-> Tiles with the same number merge when they collide, doubling the value.
-> After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears in an empty random cell.
-> The game continues until the player wins (reaching 2048) or loses (no valid moves left).

Code Explanation:

-> The code defines a Board class that sets up the game's graphical interface using Tkinter.
-> Tiles are represented as labels with appropriate colors and fonts.
-> The Game class handles the game's logic, including random tile generation, tile movement, merging, and checking for win/loss conditions.
-> The game is controlled using arrow keys, and the GUI is updated to reflect the game state.
-> If the player reaches 2048, they win the game, and if there are no valid moves left, the game ends.

This code can be used as a starting point for creating a 2048 game in Python with Tkinter. You can enhance it by adding features like a score counter, a restart button, and animations for a better gaming experience.
